Remind Me Later is a software created to allow the end user to create reminders for themselfs. Non-registered users can use the sites, but there will be no push notifications and reminders will be stored within cookies which are stored locally. A major con of this method is that if the end user clears their cookies, their reminders will also clear. To combat this problem, we offer the end user a way to store their reminders within an encrypted online MySQL database by registering on out platform. This also allows us to sync reminders between devices with a simple logon. Reminders on Remind Me Later will be cleared yearly.
